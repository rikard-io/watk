# WebAudioToolkit

A collection of classes and utils to make working with the WebAudio API a bit smoother.
Mainly for loading, scheduling and playing back audio files.

## USAGE

Use files standalone or by including the required files and instantiating them through Context.js.

## BUILD

I suggest not building but including the files you need. But a build command is provided as: `yarn build` or `npm run build`. Change src/indx.js to include any component you want to include in the build
